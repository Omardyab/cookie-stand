## This is a new project we have at LTUC 
### here will be listing what I learned during the project :)
### The project is about a cookie-Stand Shop 
working hours - 6am-7pm 
Problem: calculate-Number of cookies sold perhour 
inputs 	-min (customer per hour) 
	    -max (cph)
	    -avg per sale
Steps:
cal -number of customers per hour 
using helper function (min,max)
array can be a sol, [8,9,12,22]
2nd array [8*avg,9*avg,... ] 
expected results: 
200 300

my mistakes: 
1-access the object from outside and inside (use this, use objectname.functionname) 
2-assigning inside and outside the object can be confusing. 
3-Script should be inside the body (javascript)
4-appendChild can be used for others (not only parent)
